FONTS
-----------

Fonts are stored in the ROM, but if you have a hardware capability to store your fonts, you can use much more characters because you have more data space.

In this demo, you will find characters from 'A' to 'Z'.

FONTS CREATOR
-------------

Font characters can be created by a simple script written in visualbasic for EXCEL.
